## Introduction

The **ERPNext Time Tracker Client** is a robust desktop application designed to eliminate manual time entry and streamline the timesheet process within your ERPNext instance.

This client runs locally on your desktop, acting as a direct bridge between your focused work activity and your ERPNext Timesheets. It's built for professionals who need accurate, verifiable time logs without the distraction of constantly managing timers in a browser.

**Say goodbye to manual time entry and tedious data transcription!**

## üåü Key Features

The Time Tracker Client is engineered for accuracy, efficiency, and accountability:

### 1. Zero-Click Timesheet Automation

* **Seamless Integration:** Automatically track time spent on your selected **Projects** and **Tasks** in real-time.
* **Draft Logging:** Instantly logs activity against a designated **Draft Timesheet** in ERPNext.
* **Focus-Oriented:** Once tracking is started, the app runs in the background, allowing you to concentrate on your work without constantly managing a timer.

### 2. Optional Proof of Work (Screenshots)

* **Verifiable Activity:** The client automatically captures periodic **screenshots** of your desktop activity.
* **Secure & Private:** Screenshots are handled locally first and can be attached directly to your ERPNext Timesheet for verifiable proof of work, if required by your organizational policies.
* **Clean Start:** The app ensures that the screenshot folder is cleared before starting a new tracking session to maintain privacy and organization.

### 3. Compact & Secure Desktop Experience

* **Non-Intrusive UI:** Features a compact window size, similar to utility applications, designed to be present but not distracting.
* **Secure Connection:** Connects securely to your ERPNext server using the recommended API Key and API Secret, ensuring only authorized actions are performed.

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### Step 1: Configuration

1.  On first launch, you will be prompted to enter your ERPNext server URL, API Key, and API Secret in the **Settings** view (accessible via the gear icon **<UserRoundCog />**).
2.  Click **Save** to authenticate and connect to your ERPNext instance.

### Step 2: Start Tracking

1.  **Select a Project:** Choose the relevant project from the "Project" dropdown.
2.  **Select a Task:** Once a project is chosen, select the specific task you are working on from the "Task" dropdown.
3.  **Select a Timesheet:** Choose a **Draft** Timesheet that the time entries will be logged against.
4.  **Click "Track Time":** Once all three fields are selected, the **Track Time** button will become enabled. This starts the background timer and screenshot process.

### Step 3: Stop Tracking

(Instructions will be added here once the Timer page implementation is complete, typically involving a "Stop" button that pushes the final time log to ERPNext.)
